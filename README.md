# My website

> _“All nature is but art, unknown to thee;
> All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;"_

This website is a dynamic and iterative exploration of my evolving consciousness. It serves as a persistent platform for the dissemination of my ideas, experiences, and intellectual pursuits across a diverse range of subjects.

I'll try to frequently update the site with new content as I gain more insight into things. If you have any questions or comments, please [contact me](https://twitter.com/abhinavexists) on Twitter.

Tools used:

- neovim as editor
- tmux as terminal multiplexer
- hugo as static site generator

The design for the website is based off the [hello-friend-ng](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/) hugo theme. Much thanks to [Djordje Atlialp](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) and [Radek Kozieł](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) along with several other contributors for their work.
