## _About Me: qualification, interests, and everything in between._

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and graduated this year (at the time of writing, 2024). Every now and then, I'll find myself [nerdsniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a totally different field of interest and would end up spending a copious amount of time on the same. I play the [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKn39Cnd3nU), (used to)produce music, occasionally [distrohop](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distro-hopping) on my potato PC, build a [3d-renderer in C](https://github.com/abhinavborah/crayte) from scratch. Some of my other interests include cinema, philosophy, and mechanical keyboards.

- If you're willing to get in touch with me for work or something I can help with, I'd love to hear from you.
- If you're my potential employer, **you can find my resume [here](/files/Abhinav_Borah_Resume.pdf)**.

My first access to a PC was in 2007. It had an Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, and 256 GB HDD which I used for about a decade with little to no hardware upgrades. My PC could barely handle the newer titles and for the few games it could run over the years, I would go online and download community mods to extend it's lifespan and playability.

If someone has been on the internet long enough, they will eventually come across 'Linux' which as the saying goes, it can bring new life to an old PC. I thought I should give it a try. Sometime in circa 2012 I finally managed to get Ubuntu working on my PC and that is how my journey with linux began. From there, I was surprised by sheer customizability it had to offer. Over the years, I've distrohopped enough to finally settle down to a rolling release binary based distribution like Arch. It's been quite an interesting journey with lots of ups and downs, I can't possibly count how many times I had to deal with broken configs and packages; but at the end of the day it drives me to learn more about my system.

> _"But why should I step out of my comfort zone?"_

Well, to err is human. To err is also to learn. To learn is to live. Feed your curiosity, the world is your oyster!

**Hardware:**

- As of writing, I daily drive a Macbook Air M1 (2020 base variant) and a Lenovo Legion 5 (running arch: zenkernel, dwm + polybar) as my secondary laptop.
- For typing, I use an RK84 with gateron browns which offers 3 modes of connectivity (tri-mode): wired, wireless, and bluetooth. It lasts about a week on full charge with backlight and upto a month without the backlight.
- A Razer DeathAdder V2 mouse as it offers both wireless and bluetooth support and runs only on a single AA/AAA battery!
- My iPad Air (4th gen) as my secondary monitor and a writing device for all my note-taking needs (I might as well get an actual monitor soon).
- iPhone 12 as my daily driver.
- iPhone SE 2 which I jailbroke on [Dopamine](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine) running the [KFD exploit](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd).

**Software:**

- My IDE is a fork of lazyvim. Most of my time is spent [here](https://github.com/abhinavborah/nvim-starter) editing text.
- tmux (with resurrect and continuum) for multiplexing and restoring sessions.
- alacritty as my term because it has support for GPU acceleration. Check out my [dots](https://github.com/abhinavborah/dotfiles).
- dwm + polybar on [my arch setup](https://github.com/abhinavborah/bspwm-dotfiles) with gruvbox as my preferred color scheme.
- rectangle on macOS for window management (will be switching to Amethyst or Yabai soon).

**Tools I recommend:**

- [mailnesia](https://mailnesia.com/): anonymous email service for when sites pester you to provide your email address.
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): content filtering on your browser(s).
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) and/or [KeePassium](https://keepassium.com/): for password management.
- [openvpn](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn): VPN client.
- [qBittorent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent): P2P file sharing utility.
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) (macOS): utility to configure key mappings.
- [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser): privacy focused browser.

If you have scrolled this far, thank you once again for taking the time to read my article. It means a lot to me. I'll be updating this section (along with new blog posts) occasionally so maybe the next time you visit my website you'll find something new.
