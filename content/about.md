Hey, thank you for taking the time to visit my site. This site aims at being a brain dump for my thoughts, discoveries, and implementations. If you like reading please do consider checking out _the blog_.

## About Me, Work, Qualification, Interests, et cetera.

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and graduated this year (at the time of writing, 2024). Every now and then, I'll find myself [nerdsniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a totally different field of interest and would end up spending sleepless nights for the same. I play the [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKn39Cnd3nU), (used to)produce music, install [arch (btw)](https://github.com/abhinavborah/bspwm-dotfiles) on a potato PC to rice up my [dotfiles](https://github.com/abhinavborah/dotfiles), build a [3d-renderer in C](https://github.com/abhinavborah/crayte) from scratch. Some of my other interests include cinema, philosophy, and mechanical keyboards.

- If you're willing to get in touch with me for work or something I can help with, I'd love to hear from you.
- If you're my potential employer, **you can find my resume [here](/files/Abhinav_Borah_SWE_Resume.pdf)**.

Here is a picture of me to prove that I am indeed a real person:
