## Well, here goes nothing

After putting it off for a while, I finally took the plunge and built this site. It's been a while since I posted anything, and that, combined with my love for clean developer portfolios motivated me to get started.

I had a general idea for the design, but I wanted to keep things flexible. For the color scheme I thought [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) was a safer bet to take. [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) seemed like a good fit because I can write everything in markdown and it will SSG-fy it.

Now, I could pretend that I had prior experience with hugo but that will do no justice to the journey I had to take.
