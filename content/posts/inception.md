After putting it off for a while, I finally took the plunge and built this site. It's been a while since I posted anything, and that, combined with my love for clean developer portfolios motivated me to get started.

## Well, here goes nothing

I had a general idea for the design, but I wanted to keep things flexible. My inspiration comes from the minimal documentation styled portoflios where you can spend hours reading through the content. For the color scheme I decided to go with [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), it was an easy pick considering (at the time of writing this), most of my [ricing](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html) is some variation on the theme.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) seemed like a good fit because I can write everything in markdown and it will SSG-fy it.

Now, I could pretend that I had prior experience with hugo but that will do no justice to the journey I had to take.
